# Safe video conferencing

No one needs to be convinced of the importance of video conferencing in today’s world since hundreds of millions use these applications daily.

In this article, we look for the answer to what you should pay attention to when choosing a free video-conferencing solution (in addition to high-quality audio, video, meeting recording and other fancy functions), as well as other security aspects regarding online meetings.

A poorly chosen or incorrectly used video conference application can lead to data loss and other dangerous consequences. Even in the case of private individuals, a data breach can have dire consequences. In the case of an individual entrepreneur or company, however, you must pay attention not only to our data. In the event of damage to your customers’ data or a data leak, the consequences of the GDPR can be severe.

Therefore, a secure video conferencing platform is essential to retain customers and keep your business running smoothly. Cyber attacks are becoming more frequent with the shift to remote work and online communication solutions.

## 1.	What is video conferencing?
“[Video conferencing](https://livestorm.co/resources/guides/what-is-video-conferencing) is a live video-based meeting between two or more people. It uses the Internet to facilitate live, face-to-face interactions and collaboration through audio, video, screen sharing, and chat.”

## 2.	What are the risks of videoconferencing? [TBD]
Some video conferences may contain confidential or sensitive information, as business conversations are taking place at the conferences, where customer data, information related to new developments, financial statements and similarly confidential information may also be disclosed.

So, someone may have a financial motivation to join the meeting, spy on it or record the meeting and use the information obtained to blackmail. Some hackers may try to infiltrate a meeting and attach malware to the chat.

Uninvited participants use stolen or hacked accounts to join the meeting. It may happen, e.g., the meeting was accidentally set to “public”, and the invitation was sent this way: thus, anyone with a link can join. But it is also possible that a swindler hacks the victim’s device and establishes a connection to a video conference room through it.

## 3.	What are the features that make your video conferencing device more secure?
There are many video conferencing tools on the market, but which one should you choose and which features should you pay attention to so that their use is enjoyable and safe?

Built-in features to make your video conference more secure are as follows:

### 3.1.  Require a PIN or Password to join
If the web conference tool has this functionality, then to conduct the online meeting more securely, you can ask the participants to enter either a password or a PIN code when joining the conference, thereby confirming that only those invited to the discussion will participate. 

Of course, when communicating with meeting participants, it is advisable to share relevant sensitive data, such as passwords, PINs, meeting URLs, etc., in encrypted emails well before the scheduled time of the conference.

### 3.2. Meeting rooms
Another security feature is the possibility of creating meeting rooms. In this case, you use a shared meeting room for specific invitees, which you visit when the same people want to talk to each other.

Access to the meeting room (PIN, password, link, dial-in code, etc.) is shared once between the meeting participants, and then, using one of the same access options, they can enter the same room at any time.

The creation of rooms can be useful for security reasons and increases the software’s usability. You can create separate rooms and name them based on different projects, topics or participants, thus organising your work.

### 3.3. Lobby
The security option related to the meeting rooms is the lobby, with the help of which guests can be made to wait for the meeting room before entering it. By using this functionality, you can preserve the security of the meetings. With this method, you can filter meeting participants and prohibit or block the connection of participants not invited to the meeting.

### 3.4. Meeting lock
If the invited participants have joined the web conference, the host can close the meeting and thereby exclude the possibility of anyone joining a meeting room uninvited or even randomly.

This function is beneficial when there are many participants in a given conference, and keeping track of who joined and who left the web conference is challenging.

### 3.5. The ability to ban participants
This function also ensures that only those invited appear in the meeting room; those who were not invited (to whom the content of the discussion does not belong) may be excluded.

For instance, you may use this function if someone has been fired from a company but still logs into a meeting room. You may exclude uninvited visitors from the meeting, preventing them from accessing information no longer relevant to them.

### 3.6. Muting participants
The video conference host can mute anyone in the audience, on the one hand, for security reasons. On the other hand, if someone is giving a presentation, the host can eliminate the background noise in this way.

## 4.	What to consider to choose the best video conference solution?
Today, the problem is not that there is no software that cannot be used to perform some activity, but how to choose the most suitable one from a vast range of applications.

Below is a table showing the top 10 web conferencing apps in 2023 from five sources:

* [Livestorm](https://livestorm.co/blog/most-secure-video-conferencing-software)
* [Riverside](https://riverside.fm/blog/best-video-conference-software)
* [Tech Radar](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-video-conferencing-software)
* [G2 Com](https://www.g2.com/categories/video-conferencing)


Although there are interesting things in the table, such as the list of Livestorm or Riverside, in which both companies selected their own product as the best application, apart from that, there are also several products that are almost always in the best first five (like Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, or Zoom).
However, the choice should always be based on your own needs. Therefore, ask yourself the questions below before choosing an application:

* What do you need it for?
* How big is your company?
* What kind of tasks would you use the web conferencing service for?
* What should it be strong in?
* How many participants can take part in a conversation?
* How many participants can it use for free? 

There are web conference products that can be beneficial for small businesses (like Zoho Meetings). On the other hand, other products may be a good choice for large companies: Zoom is best for large organisations. 

In addition to the company’s size, what other existing applications are already used and how the web conferencing tool can be integrated with them can also be a vital aspect of the decision. For example, Microsoft Teams is best for those who use the Microsoft 365 suite, whereas Google Meet is an understandable choice for those who use Google Workspace. If you need ’unlimited’ cloud storage for web conference recordings, consider using GoTo Meeting.

If the quality of the recordings is also essential, check out Riverside. Most tools do not record locally but over the Internet, which can lead to a deterioration of image and sound quality in case of a possible Internet speed fluctuation.

However, in addition to the basic services provided by all web conferencing tools, there are always differences between the tools. Therefore, it is worth reading such summary comparison articles before deciding between conferencing tools as the following:

# Tips to secure your video conferencing experience

In addition to what the web conferencing tools mentioned in the article provide, a crucial thing is how you use them. Below is a collection of helpful tips to use these applications as efficiently and safely as possible:

* Use the aforementioned security functionalities (always create a meeting ID and meeting password, use a lobby, ban participants when necessary, etc.).
* Never share video conference links or codes unnecessarily.
* Always send conference access codes via an encrypted channel.
* Set up and use waiting rooms.
* When you are not using the meeting room, lock it.
* Only initiate screen sharing when necessary.
* During screen sharing, share the window of the application itself rather than the entire screen (when sharing the entire screen, others can see what browser you use, what favourite links you have saved on the bookmarks bar, what icons and files you have on your desktop, whether you use VPN, etc.).
* Use audio interaction rather than video display (webcam) as much as possible.
* When using a webcam, follow the basic rules and tips that can help prevent data theft (the background should be native, passwords, codes, personal comments should not be visible, etc.).
* Do not use public internet connections or open Wi-Fi networks in public. If logging in to a video conference from an Internet cafe is unavoidable, use a VPN to keep the connection secure.
* Use end-to-end encryption: This way, conversations/web calls can only be read or heard by your intended recipients. End-to-end encryption makes it particularly difficult for hackers to tap into the call and the data shared within it. Secure video conferencing should use 256-bit AES encryption for audio and video.
* Turn on automatic updates: always use the latest version of the application that contains the latest security patches and enhancements.

# Employee vigilance is the most essential and least expensive form of protection

No matter how reliable and perfect in terms of cyber security your device is, one of the best long-term investments is the preparation and continuous training of employees in relation to cyber security so that they are alert and use web conferencing tools properly.

Among the potential dangers of video calling on insecure software, the most significant risk is exposing your company’s sensitive information and customer data.

Relaxing or skipping security training can be tempting for individuals and small businesses. But the most crucial first-line defence for cybersecurity is user awareness and vigilance.
