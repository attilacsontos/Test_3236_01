After you have made your decision and clicked on the 'Next >' button, the Summary window appears. Here, you can see the location where Thunderbird is installed on your hard drive, and you can decide whether you want Thunderbird to become your default mail application. Click 'Upgrade' to continue:

The window that appears as the last step of the installation informs you that Thunderbird has been installed on your computer, and you can start the application by clicking on the 'Finish' button:

As the next step, the 'Set Up Your Existing Email Address' window appears. Please fill out the fields and choose a strong password. If you already have an email address (for example, in the Zimbra email client), use the same password and login (email address), so Thunderbird can check and set up your account. Click on 'Continue':

Thunderbird probes the email server and auto-populates some fields, as can be seen in the below screenshot:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_53c2edfb23d3c5d967be3874e19a5406.png)


Please use ’mail.mbox.lu’ as the Hostname. Click on 'Re-test' (if necessary), so Thunderbird can check the settings on the given mail server (mail.mbox.lu). The checkmark and the message on a green background show that the test was successful, Thunderbird found the ports of the incoming and outgoing servers, and the communication is settled. Click on 'Done'.

Please note that the configuration may change. Please contact the Helpdesk at sysadmin@lhc.lu for further information if your settings do not work.

The new window informs you that your account has been successfully created. Besides this vital information, you can modify your account settings, add a signature to your emails, and create end-to-end encryption.

Please click on 'Finish', so your Thunderbird instance opens with the below popup:

As the last step of the installation, you can set Thunderbird as the default client for your email, newsgroup, feeds and calendar. You can make these settings default (by checking or unchecking the relevant checkbox and clicking on ' Set as default'). Alternatively, you can choose 'Skip integration' if you do not want these options.
