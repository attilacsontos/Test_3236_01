# Thunderbird practical documentation for the "not too technical" individual or SOHO worker

This is a series of articles that was designed from providing extremely practical description of the steps to be followed by those who would like to benefit from Thunderbird, a powerful email client, supported by a strong community.

This documentation is a complement to the official one, and not aiming at replacing it. It's focused on some key security related aspects of the use of an email client such as Thunderbird.
The official Thunderbird documentation can be found [here](https://support.mozilla.org/fr/products/thunderbird)
