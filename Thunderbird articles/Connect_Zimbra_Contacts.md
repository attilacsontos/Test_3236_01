# How to connect your Zimbra contacts to Thunderbird?

You can connect your Zimbra contacts to Thunderbird in two ways: you may share (share a link) or move them (export them from Zimbra and import them to Thunderbird).

**Share:**

In this case, you continue to use your Zimbra instance and make your contacts available to a user (or users) who use Thunderbird (or another mail program).

**Move (import):**

In this case, you decide to use Thunderbird instead of Zimbra, and therefore, you first export your contacts from Zimbra, then import them into Thunderbird and continue your work in Thunderbird.

## 1.	How to share your Zimbra Contacts?

Open your contacts in Zimbra. Choose the contacts folder you want to share, right-click on the name of it and choose ’Share Contacts Folder’ in the pop-up menu.

The Share Properties window opens. You can set whether you want to share the chosen contacts folder with internal-, external, or public users (so anyone can access it without a password – if you share the link of the contacts folder with someone).

Also, you can set the ’Role’, that is, the user's access right (with options as follows: None, View, Edit, Add, Remove, Administer). To allow others to access the contacts folder, share the link with them (the URL can be seen at the bottom of the window, this part of the screenshot has been removed).

Now, you should be able to see the contacts in Thunderbird.

A file in the format of comma-separated values (.CSV) is created, which you should import into Thunderbird. 

Open your Address Book in Thunderbird (either click on its icon on the left panel, choose the top menu 'Tools' and then 'Address Book', or hit the hotkeys Alt+2):

The Import Wizard opens. As the first step, please choose the file format you want to use (previously, the contacts in Zimbra were exported as a .csv file; now, you should choose that file format to import).
