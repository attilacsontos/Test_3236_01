# Cybersecurity and Freelancing 


### Is it an exclusionary reason, or is there a reassuring solution?


## 1.	Freelancing is gaining ground

Freelancing has perhaps never been so trendy as nowadays: there are an estimated [1.2 billion freelancers globally](https://www.securiwiser.com/blog/the-biggest-cybersecurity-threats-freelancers-face/). There are countless Internet articles about why it is worth being a freelancer. You can also find endless job offers and specialised employment agencies regarding freelancing. And for most people, the freelance lifestyle is synonymous with freedom when the entrepreneur sits at home in pyjamas drinking coffee.

However, this article is not about why so many people choose this kind of lifestyle and work method but about what kind of cybersecurity danger they expose themselves to if they choose this. And yes, the under-representation of this topic is a good indication of the downplaying of the danger, as the related information receives much less spotlight, is more difficult to access, and requires much more research on the Internet.

At the same time, many related cybersecurity risks are associated with freelance work, which is usually not mentioned when freelancing-related opportunities are advertised.

Cybersecurity should be a hot topic and a priority for every freelancer. The responsibility of staying safe and vigilant online falls squarely on the shoulders of freelancers, as there is no designated department to deal with cybersecurity on behalf of the company's employees.

This article is for those who are either considering taking up freelance work in the future or have already embarked on this way of life (in fact, they have been doing it for years) and want to be aware of and get clues about what cyber threats they have to face during their work and what steps they can take to mitigate threats so their businesses can stay secure.

The freelance way of life and work is unique, and the threats are also specialised for it: there are cyber threats which affect freelancers more than other sectors. In this study, we also cover these and try to give tips on which methods can be the most effective against such threats.

Before we dive deeper into the discussion of the topic, we need to talk through some terms because many people confuse their meanings.

## 2.	Remote work vs teleworking

As a first step, it is essential to understand the concepts themselves because the notions of remote work and home office are often mixed up in public discourse. 

### 2.1.	Contractual relationships between an individual entrepreneur and a company

**Remote work** is one of the atypical forms of work (such as part-time work, fixed-term contract work, etc.). It appeared due to the spread of information communication technologies (ICT), and its spread was significantly increased by the closures associated with the recent pandemic.

Remote workers provide their workplace to carry out their daily work, and the place of work is usually their place of residence. It does not rule out that, in theory, they can do their work from anywhere, i.e. in an internet cafe, a library or a park. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_da3537ef868b55cc6efead409f4b476d.png)

It is crucial to note that in the case of remote work, there is only a contractual relationship between a specific company and the individual entrepreneur working remotely. Remote workers are self-employed freelancers who can agree and sign contracts with several companies: thus, these companies become clients of them.

### 2.2.	Contractual relationships between employees and employers

**Teleworking** is similar to remote work in that the employee does not work at the company's location. However, there is an employment relationship between the company and the employees. In this sense, teleworking is an arrangement where employees work from an external location instead of the official workplace. 

Telecommuting and teleworking are similar, so that you can use both terms interchangeably. The essence of telecommuting is that the work is brought to the employees instead of the employees going to work every day.

Perhaps the most significant advantage for employees is that they can do their work more flexibly from home. If, for example, they have a small child at home, or someone needs to take care of an elderly relative, or they require more freedom (without starting a private business with all its responsibilities).

If you are not quite confused yet, another term is 'Home office', which can complicate the picture even more.

In the case of the **home office**, the point is not whether remote workers are employees or self-employed, but rather the spatial separation between the place of work and who gives the work/order (who can be a client for self-employed or an employer of employees).

## 3.	Cybersecurity in the case of remote work

During (remote) work, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored in the electronic information system must be ensured as the basis of information security. 

Since the organisations were not prepared for the mass adoption of remote work, in many cases, the weak protection of IT devices and the inadequate level of data and information security awareness of employees posed a risk. Such users often panic when a security incident occurs, even a minor one.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_39f08e7f0bc04c1aeed976617fe637be.png)

It is not difficult to see that for such an employee, working from home, where there is no possible safety net provided by the system administrator or the information security officer at the workplace, further increases the risks.

This article is for freelancers with no cybersecurity 'safety net' available: no helpdesk, system admin or other help they can turn to.

## 4.	Why is cybersecurity important for freelancers?

While cybersecurity knowledge is vital for anyone who owns an electronic device, this skill is indispensable for freelancers. The simple reason is that freelancers do not have the luxury of having an entire cybersecurity team to protect them like traditional full-time employees at a company.

Given that they manage their businesses as a single person, they must be a marketer, a financier, an IT person and, of course, it also does not hurt if they also understand something about their field of expertise.

For many freelancers, their personal laptops, smartphones, and other electronic devices are essential tools that help them earn money and do their work, so having their devices hacked or stolen in some way can be costly.

Freelancers must also ensure that cyber security software (e.g. malware scanners) is installed on these digital devices to effectively combat cyber attacks (not so for traditional employees, who are usually given work laptops with these already installed).

According to [Solvere One's 2022 report](https://www.solvereone.com/cyber-attacks-on-small-businesses-increasing-in-2022/), 47% of small businesses experienced a cyber attack, meaning freelancers are also at huge risk of becoming targets.

Of course, no one can be a professional in every field, and the goal of this article is not to train professional IT specialists who understand everything from firewall protection to malware- and network forensic analysis in their own business. 

On the contrary: this article is written for people who desire to focus on their own business but want to acquire the basic knowledge necessary to consider their business safe from a cybersecurity point of view.

## 5.	The main risks that freelancers have to take into account

As an employee, the company we work for protects us against cyber threats in several ways. A company's helpdesk and IT department ensure that we, as employees, can only focus on our work and are exposed to various cyber threats as little as possible. Of course, we also must participate in this cooperation as partners. After all, protection can only work properly if the employees are alert and know what threats there may be and what they should do if they notice something suspicious.

As freelancers, we are solely responsible for everything: we take responsibility for all the activities of our company. ENISA's 2022 annual report on the state of cybersecurity ([Cybersecurity Threat Landscape](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022)) identifies the top threats and the prominent trends observed and makes it very easy to read what threats freelancers have to deal with. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_9cbae2df9b48fea736a81d2bc0c50583.png)

Cybersecurity Threat Landscape - [ENISA](https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1588508863707463680)

Let's take a closer look at the most common threats one by one.

### 5.1.	Social engineering

Social engineering is a relatively new technique attackers use to trick freelancers into handing over their confidential information. This attack can take the form of e-mails, fake downloads, and the most common but vulnerable one: phishing links.

Given the modern nature of this type of attack, social engineering is the most common method of malware/virus attacks. It is important to note that social engineering only works if a person can be tricked into handing over information that they would not otherwise do under normal circumstances. Therefore, social engineering is not about hacking IT systems but deceiving people. Social engineering is an excellent example of why self-education about cybersecurity issues is essential.

While antivirus and anti-malware software filter malware based on a built-in program, the signs of social engineering can be most effectively recognised by the individual after learning (and thereby able to neutralise such an attack).

Freelancers should be able to distinguish between such attacks and know how to respond to suspicious e-mail requests or fake invitations. The most effective way to avoid social engineering attacks is to be aware of potential weaknesses and be able to identify malicious sources. For further information, please read the article [Social engineering: The art of manipulating people](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/social-engineering-the-art-of-manipulating-people).

### 5.2.	Malware threats

Viruses, Trojans and Spyware, are dangerous software that can malign your computer and corrupt its content. Malware (malicious software) can modify applications, encrypt files, and cause all kinds of breaches and malfunctions.

Employees receive their computer as a work tool, and the IT department will most likely carry out its settings (authorisations, downloadable files and applications, etc.).

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_848b660691e996f8bbdd9e18548b5e00.png)

However, as freelancers, we decide what applications we download, we have administrator rights on our machine (with all its benefits and potential dangers), and the tools we use for work are probably the same as we use for personal use. 

Using the computer dedicated to working for private purposes (watching movies, visiting dubious websites, online shopping, visiting social media sites, etc.) and handing it over to a family member further increases the risk of the occurrence of malicious programs. 

Freelancers can reduce such risks by installing good antivirus and malware protection programs. For further reading, please follow the link [Malware: the type of software you should avoid](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/malware-the-type-of-software-you-should-avoid).

### 5.3.	Ransomware

If social engineering is perhaps the most common cyber threat freelancers must cope with, then ransomware is the most dangerous. And the reason is straightforward for this: in the case of ransomware,  freelancers may experience that the data on their computer has been encrypted and made inaccessible, and in case of failure to pay the ransom, it will be deleted entirely. 

Indeed, ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) that encrypts the files on a victim’s device or a network’s storage devices. Payment should usually be made through hard-to-trace electronic payment methods such as Bitcoin.

Remove Wannacry Ransomware in 3 Steps - [ExperTiger](https://www.expertiger.de/blog/wannacry-ransomware-entfernen-in-3-schritten/)

Ransomware is not about slowing down your computer or someone getting your password and access to one of your user accounts. Instead, your files become inaccessible after infection: you cannot work, which means an immediate loss of income.

We cannot stress the importance of backups since a well-functioning antivirus software, and firewall can provide adequate protection against ransomware. Still, the most effective and often underrated method (which takes almost only time) is to back up your data regularly.

In the case of ransomware, we must start from the fact that our data has been lost, and defences must also be designed from this point of view. A backup must be performed, from which we can restore our data as quickly as possible and thus be able to work productively and earn money again.

Read the article for more information and ways to protect your business against ransomware [Ransomware: better to be afraid than to be frightened](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/ransomware-better-to-be-afraid-than-to-be-frightened).

### 5.4.	Outdated software

Because of the freedom and lack of regulation, freelancers are not required to keep their software (and machines) up to date. Therefore, they may not regularly update their software (e.g. forget to update it), which puts them at risk from actors who want to exploit software vulnerabilities. 

Unless freelancers keep their software up-to-date and install updates when they become available, they may put unnecessarily put their data and, ultimately, their business at risk.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_1ea318792ff97a08e14f5002ddc8c827.png)

Security updates should be automatically downloaded because old software and unpatched systems are more vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If you do not adequately protect your device, there is a higher risk that attackers can access the data stored on it. Therefore, the devices you use (whether a computer or a smartphone) must install the latest software updates.

Perhaps the most striking example of why it is essential to keep your programs updated is the WannaCry ransomware attack, which broke out due to unpatched software and infected systems and businesses in more than 150 countries worldwide.

### 5.5.	Social media hacking/identity theft 

Networking, customer acquisition and online marketing can all be essential activities for which freelancers like to use social networks.

Your social media accounts, identity and reputation, are vital: damage to your reputation can have severe consequences and even be fatal to your business. This makes hacking social media accounts a real cyber threat, an absolute nightmare for freelancers who do business through these platforms. A strong password and two-factor authentication to keep your accounts secure are indispensable.

### 5.6.	Phishing

Phishing-related articles, videos, and informative materials appear pretty often in the media and can indeed pose a dire threat to freelancers. Freelancers need frequent communication with people they often do not know because of building relationships, finding new clients, and promoting their activities.

This life situation involuntarily puts them in a vulnerable position. For this reason, freelancers must be meticulous when they receive an e-mail from someone they do not know which links to click or which attachments to download.

## 6.	The possible consequences of cyber attacks

We all know that cyber attacks can have dramatic effects. This chapter briefly summarises the possible consequences of a successful cyber attack.

### 6.1.	Loss of productivity

A company's ability to function can be paralysed following a cyber attack. Depending on the nature of the attack and how much damage it caused, restoring normal operations can take hours, days, or even weeks.

Before recovery, operations may have to be halted for several days, ransoms must be paid, and devices and data storage that have become unusable must be replaced.

### 6.2.	Lost income

According to some estimates, recovering from a cyber attack can take from two weeks to half a year, depending on the nature of the attack, how much damage it caused, and how recoverable it is.

Regarding the freelance lifestyle, due to the things already mentioned above, it is easy to see that this can be a catastrophic loss for freelancers who are paid by the hour and have to pay all contributions even if they have no income.

Perhaps this is the best argument to support why an incident response and a recovery plan are essential. It is best to do everything possible to prevent a cyber attack from happening and causing damage. 

You must also do everything in order to recognise these forms of attack as soon as possible and know what to do against them. And if an attack inevitably occurs, freelancers should know what to do and where to turn for help.

When discussing the economic effects of a cyber attack, many people often only think of damages directly affecting the company and demonstrable in money. In addition to damaged IT devices, freelancers can suffer many financial disadvantages that they do not consider: the operating system and software must be reinstalled on the replaced machines. In addition, disadvantages resulting from data breaches, possible legal acts and penalties can cause incalculable financial damage.

### 6.3.	Reputation damage

Damage to reputation can have a severe negative impact on a freelancer's livelihood. Many freelancers rely on referrals and must promote themselves on social media (or dedicated freelancer sites) to find work. So if their reputation is damaged due to a data breach, it will be much more difficult to find work and build trust with clients again. After an attack, it is difficult to shake off a customer's bad opinion.

If your accounts are hacked, here are some of the most significant consequences you should consider:

* Client data stolen
* Misuse of social media accounts
* Extended downtime for your services
* Funds stolen from bank accounts
* Reputation loss
* Financial loss

### 6.4.	Data loss

Freelancers can protect themselves against accidental data loss at a relatively low cost with the following methods:

* Choose a cloud service provider that implements a secure cloud-based storage solution
* We cannot stress enough: back up at regular intervals
* Use a hardware-encrypted, branded flash drive
* Encrypt your computer's hard drive
* Use a chip card or token identification system to log in to computers
* Archive company e-mails

## 7.	How to protect your business against cyber threats?

The following tips help freelancers increase their resilience to cybersecurity threats and keep their assets as secure as possible.

It is important to be aware that there is no such thing as 100% protection. Nevertheless, the risks from cyberspace can be significantly reduced if we apply appropriate protection solutions.

The use of well-chosen, reliable applications, the creation of authorisations, authentications, secure connections (e.g. VPN), and the order of regular backups must also be essential elements of safe remote working.

The boundaries between work and private life have blurred a lot in the last few years. We tend to use the same laptop for personal entertainment and relaxation (watching Netflix series or just surfing the Net) and to perform work activities (Zoom conference calls, editing spreadsheets or creating Word articles). And this all has its own Internet security consequences.

Humans generally like to take the easiest path, the one with the least resistance and the fastest way to success. This is also what cybercriminals strive for when they try to achieve their malicious goals, so if you assume that you remain unnoticed because of the small size of our company, think again!

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_4904692bd2b5b3305b0f91093aab0e32.png)

A safety-conscious attitude is essential. Small and medium-sized businesses are the easiest and most common targets for cybercriminals, as they are usually less prepared to face security challenges than large companies due to their limited budgets and lack of IT staff.

Freelancers have to pay attention to so many tasks that more than one person typically handles at a company. In fact, they have to pay attention to all aspects of the business: marketing, social media management, acquiring new customers, accounting, etc. The forced pace of work, tight deadlines and varied obligations exhaust the freelancer after a while. It is no wonder, then, that many freelancers ignore cybersecurity.

We have all heard about the different types of cyber threats and know they can cause much damage. However, we tend not to deal with these since we have many daily problems and tasks to solve. In addition, dealing with cybersecurity is just a nuisance, a necessary evil, for which we no longer have the time and energy. 

Many people do not even have an affinity for IT or are active in a different field. Outsourcing this area to a certain degree may be a solution for them, similar to how most entrepreneurs outsource their accounting activities.

Working with a computer is unavoidable nowadays: communication on the Internet, sending and receiving e-mails, contacting customers, and invoicing are all work processes that can no longer be done without a computer.

Cybercriminals favour self-employed people and SMEs as they generally lack the resources to protect themselves, making them easy targets for an attack. The financial consequences of attacks can be significant, and their forms can appear differently: your future business may be lost, the company's reputation may be damaged, or data may be lost, or it may be highly costly to recover.

During a cyber attack, it is often not the financial loss but the loss of reputation and, thus, the turning away of customers that can cause irreversible damage and ultimately mean the end of an established business.

Let's look at some basic practical tips freelancers can use to protect themselves from becoming victims of cyber-attacks and malicious threats.

### 7.1.	Educate yourself

One of the most obvious, simplest and most cost-effective ways is to train yourself: let's see what cyber threats are the most common and what you can do to protect yourself. 

As you expand your knowledge, you come across more and more areas where you might feel that your knowledge is incomplete: make a list and add new list items to it - if necessary. After that, let's go through the list items and expand your knowledge further.

Over time, you will encounter the same words and phrases more and more often and realise that there is nothing new under the sun: the most common cyber threats are the same.

These threats are so common that you can read about them in separate articles on the [Cybersecurity Luxembourg](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/) website.

### 7.2.	Always use strong passwords

We cannot stress enough that a strong password is the first line of defence against any cyber attack or threat. Despite all this, according to the CyberNews article [Most common passwords: latest 2023 statistics](https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/most-common-passwords/), the most frequently used password is still 13456…

The interesting diagram below is available on the [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/infographic-common-passwords-by-country/) website, showing the most frequently used passwords in different countries.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_cc9a26d0eef2afc4526ed7cc4212dc4d.png)

Most common passwords around the world 2023 - [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/infographic-common-passwords-by-country/)

We have already written about the need to use a strong password, the use of password managers, the frequency of password updates and the issue of password hygiene in general. Use a password manager app to secure passwords for each account.

### 7.3.	Use multi-factor authentication on all accounts

Two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication is a security setting that can add additional protection to any user account. If you log into one of your accounts, a user ID and a password are required for authentication. If that is all it takes to authenticate, it is one-factor authentication.

If additional authentication is required to log in to your account after entering the user ID and password, we are talking about multi-step authentication (depending on how many steps this authentication consists of, it can be two-factor or multi-factor authentication).

After entering the user ID and password, you can verify that the given account belongs to you with secondary authentication data: either with a unique code sent to a specific e-mail address, a token, a biometric scan, or a random code generated by an authentication application. 

Two- and multi-step authentication has been known for years in the banking sector, for example. These technologies have become increasingly common in other sectors, as protecting personal data is a high priority.

### 7.4.	Pay close attention to data management 

Considering that as a freelancer, you work with a lot of personal or other company data and process them, pay close attention to the security of data management and the regulations of the GDPR. You can read more information about the relationship and importance of encryption and GDPR in the article [Encryption: The unnoticed law enforcement force in cyberspace](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/encryption-the-unnoticed-law-enforcement-force-in-cyberspace).

You may work for many clients and manage their data as a freelancer. Before a company hires you, the freelancer must sign various legal documents and a non-disclosure agreement to protect the hiring company and its clients.

It is, therefore, easy to have a large amount of data and documents at your disposal at any given time, which could be completely wiped out by a data breach. A data breach can cause fatal financial consequences that you want to avoid at all costs. Adequate encryption can be helpful against possible data leaks.

### 7.5.	Use privacy-enhancing technologies

Install a variety of privacy-enhancing technologies in your browser to reduce the risk of surfing the web, such as by flagging unsafe websites and blocking spyware or other malicious code that may be running on the website.

You may install the [Web of Trust](https://www.mywot.com/) (WOT) module on your browser. After installation, the module allows you to evaluate the visited pages according to authenticity, confidentiality, etc. Similarly, you can also see the reviews given by other Internet users, so you can get an idea of a site that is still unknown. For further reading, please visit [Web of Trust – WOT](https://www.cases.lu/knowhow/glossary/WOT.html).

### 7.6.	Back up your data frequently

If you store a lot of data natively on your devices, back it up to a cloud every few weeks. Although most backups are done automatically, some software may require a manual backup. You can read more information about cloud storage in this article [Cloud security: Is it wishful thinking or reality?](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/cloud-security-is-it-wishful-thinking-or-reality)

Backing up your data means that if an attack occurs and your devices are compromised, you can quickly restore everything (till your last backup) to minimise damage. This also means that you are less vulnerable to cybercriminals in the event of a ransomware attack – for instance.

Regular backups are as essential as password protection for your data security. Not only is it an effective solution in the event of unexpected system failures, but it is also essential in the fight against cybercriminals. In order to protect your data, one of the most critical, essential and apparent things is to make backups at regular intervals. Please read the article [Backup: Digital lifebelt for your irreplaceable files](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/backup-digital-lifebelt-for-your-irreplaceable-files).

### 7.7.	Use only a reliable Wi-Fi network.

First, you must consider making your home Wi-Fi network more secure. Securing your home Wi-Fi access point is the first and one of the most critical steps to creating a secure home network.

#### 7.7.1.	Change the admin password

Use the browser to navigate to the IP address specified in the Wi-Fi router’s device manual and change the admin password. On most Wi-Fi access points, you can access the administrator account with a default password, through which you can change the settings of the device. However, these preset passwords may be known by anyone or even published publicly on the Internet.

Use a unique, strong password for the admin account so only you can access it! If the device allows it, change the username of the admin account as well!

#### 7.7.2.	Create a network password

Set up your Wi-Fi network, which should also be protected with a unique, strong password (make sure it is different from your admin password). This way, you can ensure that only those you trust can connect to your home network. Consider using a password manager to choose a strong password and keep track of your passwords.

#### 7.7.3.	Update the firmware automatically

Enable automatic updating of the Wi-Fi router’s firmware, i.e. its operating system. This way, you can ensure that your device is as safe as possible and has the latest security solutions (actually, it's the same as with any other software: we recommend automatic updates to always run on the latest version).

If the automatic update cannot be enabled, log into the device regularly and check for available updates. If your device is no longer supported by the manufacturer, consider purchasing a new device to get the latest security features.

#### 7.7.4.	Use a guest network

The guest network is a virtually-isolated network that can be created on the Wi-Fi access point. It means that there are actually two networks on the device at the same time. The primary network is the one to which your trusted devices are connected, such as your computers, smartphones or tablets. 

The guest network is the one to which ‘untrusted’ devices can connect, for example, your visitors' devices. Devices connected to the guest network cannot see communications on the primary network.

### 7.8. Use only legitimate software

Cracked software downloaded from illegal channels may contain harmful codes (e.g. spyware, extortion viruses). As an individual entrepreneur or freelancer, you are still required by law to use clean software. Using illegal software is entirely pointless, irresponsible and dangerous in many ways

### 7.9. Use VPNs

Virtual private networks, or VPNs, allow you to create a secure, encrypted network when using a public network, such as Wi-Fi, in a public place. The VPN ensures that the connection cannot be hacked and routes it through a trusted provider to protect against hacking.

Freelancers often work with different clients at the same time. While working on multiple projects, managing and protecting confidential client data for freelancers is an even more challenging yet essential task.

Using a VPN is one of the most practical ways to ensure that your clients' data does not fall into the wrong hands. VPNs are carefully designed to protect your data while in transit over a public or shared network.

VPNs are beneficial for freelancers who do not always work from the same location and may work in public places that are not secure from a data point of view. Do not be fooled by legitimate Wi-Fi names: hackers often mimic public networks to create a clone, so only connect to a public Wi-Fi network if you use a VPN to protect it.

### 7.10.	 Use an antivirus

It is more like a list item (so you do not miss out on what a freelancer needs), and I would not explain why it is needed. I think this should not be a question anymore; it should be self-explanatory. This is one of the essential things we need to have a permanent, continuous monitoring system to minimise cyber attacks.

## 8.	Practical cybersecurity tips for freelancers

Follow these cybersecurity best practices to ensure the safety precautions you need to stay productive while working remotely.

* Keep your operating system and applications up-to-date.
* Install antivirus software and update it regularly.
* Secure your home network, and change your router’s password (the network must be encrypted and accessible only with a password).
* Separate work and personal devices: use a computer dedicated to work.
* Avoid connecting interfaces (USB keys, memory cards, etc.) with uncertain origin.
* Watch out for phishing scams, and be careful when checking your e-mails and social networks.
* Follow the recommendations regarding password usage.
* Enable ‘find my device’ and ‘remote wipe’.
* Use a virtual private network.
* Follow special security rules while [videoconferencing](https://securitymadein.lu/cyber/news/videoconferencing-and-cybersecurity/)

You should avoid doing these things while working remotely to make your home a cyber-secure place to work:

* Do not delay updates
* Do not turn off the VPN
* Do not connect to any public, unknown or insecure network
* Do not share your company laptop or devices with other family members

## 9.	Create an incident response plan

It may seem a little complicated at first, but to understand what it is, you need to know some basic terms. Knowing these, it becomes self-evident and logical that you need an incident response plan.

### 9.1.	What is a security incident?

A cyber incident or cyber security incident is an event that may compromise data confidentiality, integrity or availability. In practice, this may include unauthorised data leakage, unlawful data processing, changing data without consent, or malicious attempts to disrupt or deny service.

### 9.2.	What is incident response?

Incident response is all activities undertaken in response to cyber incidents: responding to, managing and mitigating cyber security incidents. The purpose of incident response is to limit the damage and disruption caused by cyber-attacks and, where necessary, restore operations as quickly as possible.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_d1688c88c676fe4f8fbc71cc96754564.png)

### 9.3.	How to respond to a security incident?

When a security incident occurs, it is important not to panic. Effective incident response requires a clear plan outlining your steps in various scenarios. In plain English, you have to think about, and model what you would do in the event of a cyber attack, how you would react, where you would go for help, etc.

### 9.4.	So, what is an incident response plan?

An incident response plan is a set of activities and procedures that outline the organisation's (your company’s) response to security incidents. An incident response plan aims to promptly and effectively mitigate incidents by clarifying what actions must be taken and by whom.

Since freelancers usually carry out activities related to their business alone, they should consider what cybersecurity threats they might face and what steps they would take to respond to them.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_d9d2a3ccb0d08a8af403cacbad7d1d52.png)

### 9.5. How to develop an incident response plan?

Cyber incidents can be highly diverse, and their frequency of occurrence changes over time. If we work for a company with an IT department, there will most likely be a distinguished person/s who monitors the possible risks of such cyber attacks.

However, freelancers are not in such an advantageous position, so they must do everything they can to be informed about the current threats, what should be done against them, and how. It is a good idea to watch videos on cybersecurity-related topics from time to time, read online articles or a magazine, and use that information to increase your cyber resilience and awareness.

Suppose you do not have time for this (since most freelancers are usually very busy in the first place), or you do not have the affinity to deal with this topic. In that case, it is worth asking for the help of professionals and increase the degree of protection and resilience of your business against cyber attacks.

## 10.	 How to work with your clients?

Working as a freelancer for your clients and paying attention to cybersecurity is two-edged: both parties must be aware of the possible risks.

In this chapter, we look at things from the freelancers' perspective to pay attention to when working with their clients.

Obviously, the situation is different when we work for a global multinational company than when we fulfil the mandate and work for a private person we do not know on Fiver or Upwork. 

A multinational company has mature IT procedures, and often an entire department works to make the given company less vulnerable possible from a cybersecurity point of view. In the case of a mature, cyber-aware company, we need to worry less than in the case of an unknown individual. It is essential to discuss the channels through which the cooperation will take place.

Position yourself as a company! If you are a private entrepreneur (a freelancer), develop a corporate image and behave like a company: build trust and increase your reputation.

### 10.1.	Mobile messaging/ Chat / Web conferencing
 
Use secure messaging to communicate with the customer. Be aware of the risks associated with sharing confidential information in e-mail and messaging applications. Use a strong password, multi-factor authentication and encrypt messages if possible.

If you work from home, follow the security regulations mentioned above: change the password of your router, and use a firewall and VPN. If you often work away from home (in an Internet cafe, in other public places, from a library, etc.), then be even more careful: always use a VPN.

### 10.2.	Isolate tasks

Create and apply a mutually agreed workflow and use a project tracking application, so the tasks are clearly defined and can easily be tracked. This way, you can break your assignment down into small chunks of tasks that can be secured on completion, so fewer data is compromised if your device is breached.

### 10.3.	Position yourself as a company

If you are a private entrepreneur (a freelancer), develop a corporate image and behave like a company: build trust and increase your reputation.

To achieve this, it is essential to use reliable tools and applications, especially with regard to the strength of their defense against cyber attacks.

### 10.4. Use reliable office suites

Use a reliable office software package to work efficiently. It is not necessary to choose paid software packages from well-known giant companies. In this chapter, we briefly mention some open-source, free, yet full-fledged alternatives of the well-known Microsoft or Google products.

It does not matter what we call the given application, in fact, we always want to do the same things, whether as a private person or as a freelancer: such activities are word processing, spreadsheet creation, presentation creation, e-mailing, etc.

When choosing a software package, the following aspects may be of interest in addition to those mentioned above:

* Custom, ad-free e-mail address for your business.
* Option for holding secure online meetings.
* The ability to store and share files securely from any device.
* Enhanced document review and collaboration tools.

NeoOffice is a fork of the open-source OpenOffice platform and has almost all the functions of the program package for Mac: you can do word processing, drawing, making spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, and even database programming.

### 10.5. Why should you use such software packages?

The advantages of using these reliable software packages can be summarised in the following:

* **They include all the necessary applications** needed for efficient office work.
* **They increase your credibility**
A paid service can increase your credibility because you can set up your domain, create your brand name, and use the same domain as a business e-mail. 
* **You can say goodbye to spam**
These software packages contain effective spam filters, so you do not need to deal with irrelevant e-mails and can focus on your business partners. No advertising, phishing, or suspicious offers: you receive only official letters and information from sites that are important to you.
* **Better compliance with data protection requirements**
As a freelancer, you must carefully handle your customers' data and comply with the European Union's relevant requirements and the rules of the GDPR.
* **Availability**
If you are on a paid plan, it is reasonable to expect that the given service is always (99,9%) available.
* **Fast and reliable product support**
Although there is much advice on their websites, and you can also search in the forums and help, finding the right information can be very time-consuming. Every minute counts when you have a problem with an application: if you do not receive quick answers and cannot work, you are losing profit.
* **Storage differences**
If you are serious about freelancing, another reason to subscribe is the difference in storage capacity. As long as you get a few gigabytes as a private person, you can get a much larger storage space in a paid package.
You will most likely need this if you plan for the long term. Over time, you will have more and more customers and need to store an increasing amount of data in a safe place, so it is no longer worth saving on this.
* **Affordability**
Many service packages are cheaper than a lot of people might think. Especially if you do not look at the packages based on the gross price but compare them with how much you can save. If you get higher availability with a paid subscription and you can be sure that your customers' data is more secure with it, is it worth the extra cost for the paid service?

### 10.6. What kind of e-mail clients should you use?

As a freelancer, one of the most critical needs is to communicate with clients and establish a secure relationship, which in most cases happens via e-mail or phone. Below are some e-mail services with a strong focus on cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy.

* **Proton Mail**

[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/) is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted e-mail service that uses client-side encryption to protect e-mail content and user data before they are sent to Proton Mail servers. It provides robust, end-to-end and zero access encryption, password-protected e-mail, encrypted contacts, and 2FA hardware security keys - to mention some security features of Proton Mail. The [Proton for Business](https://proton.me/business/features) page shows all the solutions you need to have a secure, bullet-proof e-mail account for your business.

* **MailFence**

[Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/) is an encrypted e-mail service that offers OpenPGP-based end-to-end encryption and digital signatures. Besides messages, you can use the Calendar, the Documents and the Groups (your contacts) features.

## 12.	Conclusions

Small businesses are attractive targets for cybercriminals because they generally lack the cybersecurity precautions of larger organisations and the dedicated IT teams responsible for cybersecurity. 

Although freelance life has advantages and perks, being solely responsible for cybersecurity can potentially leave freelancers and their businesses vulnerable to cyberattacks. Understanding these threats and knowing how to defend against them is essential to maintaining security and a prosperous business in the long term.

As cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, freelancers must use more defensive strategies and tools to ensure their systems and sensitive information are always protected.

The consequences of a cyber attack can be very diverse and highly costly, from lost productivity to damage to a company's reputation. According to the [MyBusiness](https://www.mybusiness.com.au/resources/news/more-than-half-of-small-businesses-close-after-a-cyber-attack#:~:text=A%20global%20cyber%20security%20firm,cyber%20event%20on%20small%20businesses.&text=According%20to%20the%20United%20States,data%20breach%20or%20cyber%20attack.) online platform, about 60% of SMEs go out of business within six months of a data breach or cyberattack.

Many freelancers feel that their business is "too small" to be affected by a cyber incident. So they do not realise the severity of the attack until it is too late: when the incident has already occurred.

This article tries to help make freelancers aware of the seriousness of the situation and change their attitude. By using strong passwords and multi-step authentication, regularly implementing and planning backups, being cautious and attentive, and expanding knowledge, you can take a giant step towards not becoming a victim of cyber attacks. Because even with a small investment of energy and money, it is possible to defend against many cyber attacks very effectively.

This article mentions the biggest cybersecurity threats facing freelancers in particular. Those working in this sector need to be aware of these threats.

According to Verizon's [2022 Data Breaches Investigations Report](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/), 82% of data breaches involved human contribution. Reduce the cost of human error and do not be the cause of a successful cyber attack. Follow the guidelines above and do not hesitate to [report an incident](https://circl.lu/report/) if the inevitable occurs.
