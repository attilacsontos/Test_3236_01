Create a GitHub Pages site - for freelancers

# The purpose of this project

## The project aims to build a community-centred documentation for remote workers, freelancers or SOHOs, in order to help them securely and safely operate online.

Individual and SOHO workers are exposed as anyone to online risks. But they often lack the resources to afford both security solutions and services that are available for more resourced entities.


You will find here practical guides that should help you to operate specific solutions in a way that reduces the cyber risks you are exposed to.




We are sending our message to self-employed people who are just learning about remote work and who, in addition to the advantages of remote work, feel and know that acquiring and developing knowledge about cyber security is essential for a successful business life, whatever the company's profile is.

In addition, they do not just want to consume the content created here; they also want to share their experiences actively and would like to participate in developing and increasing the content created here.
The cloud-based repository hosting service, GitHub, is an excellent tool to achieve this goal. On this platform, we can openly share and improve the content while increasing the community in terms of number and activity.

We do hope that the content prepared here will be beneficial for those who do not yet have the proper routine of remote work or sole proprietorship and who miss content on the Internet about the cyber security aspects of this kind of work.

We feel that this project fills a real gap since finding content on the Internet about cybersecurity issues for workers in this situation is challenging. Therefore, we encourage our dear readers to take an active part in this project and share their experiences so that the content of the platform is as up-to-date and helpful as possible for those who are just starting this type of activity, suffer from a lack of information and the content here can provide solutions to their everyday problems.
